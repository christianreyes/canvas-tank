Instructions!
			
Left/right arrow to move the truck. Up/down arrow to move the launcher. Space bar to shoot an arrow. Hold it to shoot LOTS of arrows.

The p2-containers-test and the p2-primitives-test need to be refreshed in order to properly load the images.

There is also a glitch of switching tabs or not having the game in focus. Lots of balls load up and want to move across the screen.
